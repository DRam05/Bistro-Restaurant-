Bugs/Limitations
- The main file outputs the users seed after they put it in, I cannot for the life of me find where it runs 
that code in all of the files and methods after the last couple of days of creating this so 
I honestly gave up.
- I used many tests throughout the code, mostly in the main file, to see if certain methods ran as they should
for example, loadPantry and processOrder gave me and chatGPT a hard time for days with exception lines and 
error codes so there may still be code like that lying around, like the seed checker that is there 
somewhere that I may have missed. 

Seed = for (char c : netID.toCharArray()){s = s + (int)c}
    This takes every individual character in the user input and automatically assigns its ASCII value, 
    then adds them together
CheckSum = Math.round(orderSubtotal*100 + seed + totalUnitsUsedAllIngredients) % 9973;
    This takes the subtotal and multiplies it by 100 and rounds it to an integer since it was a double, 
    adds it to the seed generated by the user input, adds it to all the units in the recepies, and gives
    the remainder (or Mod) of that after dividing it by 9973.
