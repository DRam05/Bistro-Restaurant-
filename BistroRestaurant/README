# Byte Bistro – Restaurant Ordering Simulation

A mock restaurant ordering application written in Java. This program was developed as a university course project. The application focuses on object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and subclasses, the use of Java collections, file input/output, and mathematical operations using ASCII character values to generate discounts and receipts.

## Technologies

- **Java** (Object-Oriented Programming)

- **Java Collections Framework**
  - `ArrayList`
  - `HashMap`

- **File I/O**
  - Reading CSV files
  - Reading plain text files
  - Writing output transcripts

- **Random Number Generation**
  - `java.util.Random` with seeded randomness

- **Exception Handling**
  - Custom exceptions for inventory validation

- **Date & Time API**
  - `LocalDateTime` for receipt timestamps

## Features

### Seed Calculation
- A deterministic seed is calculated using the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the user’s NetID.

- This seed ensures that the following are reproducible for the same NetID:
  - The daily discount
  - Ingredient spoilage
  - Checksum calculation

---

### Daily Discount Generation
- The discounted category is determined by:
  ```
  dayIndex = seed % 3
  ```
  - `0` → Entree  
  - `1` → Beverage  
  - `2` → Dessert  

- The discount percentage is determined by:
  ```
  discountPercent = 3 + (seed % 5)
  ```

- Only one category per day receives a discount.

---

### Inventory Validation
- Before any order is processed:
  - The program verifies that the pantry has enough ingredients for all orders.
- If inventory is insufficient:
  - An `InsufficientInventoryException` is thrown.
  - No inventory is deducted.

---

### Pantry Management
- Pantry inventory is reduced:
  - When orders are fulfilled
  - When spoilage is applied
- Ingredient quantities are never allowed to drop below zero.

---

### Spoilage Simulation
- After all orders are processed, a random number of ingredients spoil:
  ```
  m = 1 + (seed % 2)
  ```
- Each spoiled ingredient loses a random amount between 1 and 3 units.
- Spoilage is recorded and displayed in the receipt transcript.

---

### Receipt Generation
- The program generates a detailed receipt transcript that includes:
  - Discount information
  - Itemized orders by category
  - Discounted prices where applicable
  - Subtotal
  - Tax (6%)
  - Final total
  - Spoilage report
  - Ending pantry inventory
  - Checksum value

## The Process

- For this project, I was provided with a UML diagram that showcased all required files and methods. Along with the UML diagram, some files were partially completed while others were empty and required full implementation.

- I began with the `Ingredient` class by implementing the constructor and getter methods.

- Next, I worked on the `IngredientAmount` class, implementing constructors, getters, and the `setRequiredAmount` and `deduct` methods to manage ingredient quantities during order processing.

- I then implemented constructors and getters for the `MenuItem` and `OrderLine` classes.

- After that, I completed the `Pantry` class, which loads ingredient data from a CSV file and validates whether sufficient ingredients exist to fulfill incoming orders.

- I then implemented the `Orders` class, which reads the order script file, validates orders against the pantry, computes subtotals with applicable discounts, builds the receipt, and calculates the total amount of ingredients used.

- Next, I implemented the `Restaurant` class, which generates the seed based on the user’s NetID using ASCII values and determines which menu category receives a discount and by how much.

- Finally, I completed the `Main` file, which reads the input files (`ingredients.csv`, `recipes.csv`, and `orders.txt`), prompts the user for their NetID, and outputs a `receipt.txt` file to the `lib` folder. The receipt displays order details, applied discounts, spoiled ingredients, and the ending pantry inventory.

## What I Learned

- How file input/output integrates real-world data into programs
  - Reading `.txt` and `.csv` files
  - Writing processed data to output files
- How object-oriented design helps manage complex systems
- Writing code that follows a UML diagram and specification
- How seeded randomness allows reproducible simulations
- The importance of separating responsibilities across classes

---

## Seed and Checksum Formulas

### Seed Formula
```java
for (char c : netID.toCharArray()) {
    s += (int) c;
}
```
This takes each character in the user’s NetID, converts it to its ASCII value, and sums the values to produce the seed.

---

### Checksum Formula
```java
Math.round(orderSubtotal * 100 + seed + totalUnitsUsedAllIngredients) % 9973;
```
This formula multiplies the subtotal by 100 and rounds it to an integer, adds the seed and the total number of ingredient units used, and then computes the remainder when divided by 9973.
